Age, Attrition, BusinessTravel, Department, DistanceFromHome, EducationField, EmployeeNumber, EnvironmentSatisfaction, Gender, JobInvolvement, JobLevel, JobRole, JobSatisfaction, MaritalStatus, MonthlyIncome, OverTime, PercentSalaryHike, PerformanceRating, RelationshipSatisfaction, StockOptionLevel, TotalWorkingYears, TrainingTimesLastYear, WorkLifeBalance, YearsAtCompany, YearsInCurrentRole, YearsSinceLastPromotion, and YearsWithCurrManager.

This Power BI project analyzes employee attrition trends using interactive dashboards. The dataset includes key attributes such as age, department, job role, monthly income, years at the company, and job satisfaction to identify factors influencing employee turnover.
